# Lambå-atlas

## What is Lambå-atlas?
Lambå-atlas is a platform for sharing knowledge among plastic surgeons worldwide. It acts as a closed forum where colleagues across the world can discuss and help each other with medical cases. Each case is represented as one thread and can among other things contain text, images, video as well as a comment field where other users can discuss the case. This application facilitates learning and also helps globalize the medical field.

This repo contains a development prototype of the application, intended to be deployed in the future.
